            <h3>What Cats is</h3>
            <p> 
                Cats is the site you are on right now! This site is all
                about cats! <br>
                This site is entirely made by me (Martijn)
            </p>
            <h3>Why you are here</h3>
            <p> 
                You are here to check if my site works correctly, you see, 
                this site is not online anywhere yet! <br>
                This site is supposed to have at least 5 pages, but it has 6.<br>
                It also needs to be an easily readable HTML with good use of semantic tags.<br>
                You should be the one checking if the site meets the criteria given.
            </p>
            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>Whats with all the cats?</h3>
            <p>
                If you have spend some time on this site you might have seen some cats here and there. <br>
                Since the actual content of the site didn't matter, I chose to make this site cat related. <br>
                I chose to put all my favourite cat pics/gifs on the site because I thought it would be cool.
            </p>
            <h3>WHERE ARE THE CAT PICS?!?!</h3>
            <p> Now calm down, this part of the site only contains 2 different pictures, <br>
                If you want to see the full gallery, look at the top of the screen and click <br>
                <a href="cats.html">Cat pics/gifs</a> or use the link right here.</p>
