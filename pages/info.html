            <h3>What Cats is</h3>
            <p> 
                Cats is the site you are on right now! This site is all
                about cats! 
                This site is entirely made by me (Volt).
                I had to make it for a final assignment for school. 
                I haven't been graded yet :(.
            </p>
            <h3>Why you are here</h3>
            <p> 
                You are here to see how epic this website is of course B).
                If you are bored of the cats you can screw around with the site and see how it reacts to 
                different types of screen sizes and devices.
            </p>
            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>Whats with all the cats?</h3>
            <p>
                If you have spend some time on this site you might have seen some cats here and there. 
                Since the actual content of the site didn't matter, I chose to make this site cat related. 
                I chose to put all my favourite cat pics/gifs on the site because I thought it would be cool.
            </p>
            <h3>WHERE ARE THE CAT PICS?!?!</h3>
            <p> Now calm down, this part of the site only contains 2 different pictures, 
                If you want to see the full gallery, look at the top of the screen and click 
                <a href="cats.html">Cat pics/gifs</a> or use the link right here.</p>
